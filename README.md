<h1 align="center">Welcome to Music-Downloader üëã</h1>

An express website for downloading YouTube and Spotify music in different formats.

## üèì Installation

- Complete the file `config.json`.

What is `client` in the configuration file ?

If you enable the client function so 'true', then you will be able to configure the following information : `token` (token of your Discord bot), `webhookID` and `webhookPassword`. 
If you enable this function it will send a message for each request on the site in the configured webhook.
If you don't know how to create a Discord webhook, just click [here](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/webhooks.html#creating-webhooks).
If you don't want to use the logs you can disable the function by assigning the value 'false' to 'client'.

- Type `npm install` in your command prompt to install the dependencies.
- To start the program, type this `node index`.

There you go ! The site is loaded on : `http://localhost:(port)`.
Example if the port is 3000 : `http://localhost:3000` if you use a virtual machine the structure will be this one : `http://(ip):3000`.
